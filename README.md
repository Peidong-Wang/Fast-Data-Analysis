## Fast-Data-Analysis

This is a workspace for building fast data analysis toolkits.

The first paradigm is a **RandomForestClassifier** for an artifical dataset quoted from Andrew Cross.[random-forests-in-python-with-scikit-learn](http://www.agcross.com/2015/02/random-forests-in-python-with-scikit-learn/)

The second paradigm is for a general data analysis model for real-world datasets. Its main framework is from Sunil Ray.[Build a Predictive Model in 10 Minutes (using Python)](http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/09/build-predictive-model-10-minutes-python/) This paradigm, however, does not work currently.

The dataset used in paradigm 2 is SF Salaries from Kaggle. The origninal dataset was divided into train and test sets from the 105000th data sample.

Further investigation on the second paradigm is in progress.
